<p>I have just finished reading <a href="https://press.stripe.com/the-revolt-of-the-public">The Revolt of the Public</a> by Martin Gurri which provides a great analysis of the current sociopolitical climate in the West. I&rsquo;m a software engineer based in France, and with the self-immolation of Germany&rsquo;s energy sector, Putin knocking on the door and the looming possibility of a Trump holding it open for him, I&rsquo;ve started to feel responsible given my informatics background to help europe <em>get its act together</em>.</p>

This rebellion is fueled by the information explosion, which has democratized knowledge and destabilized traditional power structures.</p>
<p>While this destabilization has led to chaos in all its major instances, I&rsquo;ve anecdotally been experiencing the growing sentiment against nichilism in my day-to-day, prompting for an optimistic vision much like the one at the end of the book.

I will argue that in the past couple of years a number of crucial innovations have made it possible to nudge the system towards this vision [+ small cultural step needed]

<!-- In The Origins of Political Order, -->
<p>The fundamental structure underlying govenrment and all of its problems is the  principal-agent model, where the public (Principal) hire government offcials (Agent) to [enact policy] to the benefit of the public. The necessity of such a model arises in scenarios of imperfect information, (unlike, for example, in a cryptocurrency).<label for="sn-blockchain" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-blockchain" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="sidenote">
When token prediction models will exterminate humanity and we&rsquo;ll be left with just computers, this model will be no longer needed, and will be more akin to a blockchain, where each actor has perfect information of the world and can be both the agent and the principal.

<!-- In order for this relationship to be fruitful at scale, Fukuyama identifies 3 pillars of *modern government*: State Capacity, Accountability and Rule of Law. [explain them]

From a purely informatics perspective (already ambitious plan of reforming the information part) we can address some aspects of state capacity and accountability, assuming a working underlying rule of law (which westerns states have too much of -> US) and state monopoly over violence (which even worse states have), the most important prerogative according to Friedman. 

If we try to overlay these attributes on our <del>Erlang's concurrency</del> principal-agent model, we obtain a structure like the following: the outgoing edges representing the state's capacity to capture data and enact effective policies with it, the self-edges representing accountability,

<p>Of course the article doesn&rsquo;t provide any specific guidance on the implementation so, given the current absence of incentive structures, none of this exists with interoperable standards and any resemblance of a user experience.

<p>Despite efforts by Big Tech to dominate the whole of online activity, there remains a notable separation among their respective datasets: Google has your intents, Facebook your messages and Amazon your items, which are all partial apsects of you. While third-party data processors such as Nielsen and LiveRamp do have access to a wider window into our lives (like household composition and income level), no single entity possesses both a wide and deep view of all the data, except for the individual user themselves.</p>
<p>Personal privacy is of course fundamental. While the ideal state might be the aforementioned blockchain-like society, where perfect information is available, we must consider the realities of our human psychology. The chilling effect occurs when individuals hesitate to search for information or express opinions online due to fear of future repercussions. This not only compromises personal freedom but also hinders creativity, innovation, and the free flow of ideas, which are crucial for a thriving and progressive society.</p>
<p>Yet there&rsquo;s a tradeoff as described by the concept of differential privacy, which ironically enough was first applied by the U.S. Census Bureau. In order for data to be useful and draw predictions from it, we need it in aggregate (also equivalence of aggregation with NNs): [explain quickly]
research has shown that there are many ways to produce very accurate statistics from the database while still ensuring high levels of privacy.[1] </p>

<p>(How does this data then become useful? Ok, everything is confidential and all but still there&rsquo;s a risk and i&rsquo;m willing to expose myself only if there&rsquo;s a benefit) Let&rsquo;s draw a parallel with ads. Some people are ok with ads, they find some interesting things and are willing to buy them, for some people ads are completely useless and they&rsquo;ve never clicked on one (apparently all the norwegians). Your milage may vary but on average very few of the ads we see have anything to do with us. Why should they have my data if the targeting is so bad? The same applies with government. why would i give all this data? see next paragraph</p>

<p>also different leves of decisions. like whether to invade or not a country is not decentralized information, but some economic policy might be. plus capitalism is already decentralized but some things need to be carried out by govt. since money doesn&rsquo;t account for externalities and some things are too expensive like buidling a nuclear power plant</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important is that not only the policy implemented is scientifically sound, but also that it aligns with the morality of the principal. (again having to reckon with psychology)</p>

<p>According to Haidt, the public is fundamentally moral: group selection. Disconnect in perception of legitimacy → the principal might not have as much data about the global state as the agent, so analyzes choice based on internal value and personality model</p>
<p>while the exhaustiveness and exclusiveness of the dimensions is an area of acitve research, the fundamental truth is group behavior.</p>
<p>change this into group selection -&gt; [Personality and morality -&gt; somewhat stable internal state, hard to change. is also praty genetic, carrying over information from the previous generation.]</p>
<!-- Like Haidt, i believe pluralism of moralities is generally positive. yet when i first read his book some years ago i was still finding myself thinking "oh that's how i'm gonna convince these dumb (prograssives/coservatives) that my (conservative/prograssive) view is the best!". I'll provide a more abstract analogy to hopefully avoid this for you. -->
<p><img alt="MFT" src="images/mft.png"></p>
<p>Imagine politics as an optimization problem using gradient descent. the difference with gradient descent is that local knowledge is not unique: you can image of two forces. we can use one person on the left and one on the right as simplification (this side is steeper! no, this side is steeper!).
The set of points is the same (the empirical truth) but both characters have different interpretations for these points using their morality. (give an example)</p>
<p>with democracy we now have millions of these agents and millions of different moralities -&gt; meaning groups, teams.
For a government to be perceived as legitimate we have to pick the average of all interpretations of the points. the government could also get lucky and reach the optimum picking one of the curves at random, but that&rsquo;s not the point of democracy.</p>
