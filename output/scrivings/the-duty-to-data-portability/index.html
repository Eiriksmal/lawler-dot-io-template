<p>I have just finished reading <a href="https://press.stripe.com/the-revolt-of-the-public">The Revolt of the Public</a> by Martin Gurri which provides a great analysis of the current sociopolitical climate in the West.

<!-- For the theoretical foundations of my thesis, I’ll try to reconcile Fukuyama, Blockchain, Data rights, and Erlang’s actor model (?) oversimplyfing the world like a fellow Grug Brained Developer does.<label for="sn-grug" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">
[Definitely not Erlang then](https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-concurrency), I think I meant the Principal-agent Model.
</span> -->
<p>In The Origins of Political Order, Fukuyama identifies 3 pillars of Modern government: state capacity, accountability and Rule of Law. Up close, these pillars are an intertwined network of actors, as represented by <del>Erlang&rsquo;s concurrency model</del> the principal-agent model, where the public (Principal) hire government offcials (Agent) to enact policy to their benefit. When token prediction models will exterminate humanity and we&rsquo;ll be left with just computers, this model will be no longer needed, and will be more akin to a blockchain, where each actor has perfect information of the world and can be both the agent and the principal. </p>
<p>Add some words on Friedman, state monopoly over violence, and rule of law at the basis of everything.</p>
<p>If we try to forcibly stretch Fukuyama’s framework over the principal-agent model, we obtain something like this:   </p>
<p><img alt="Principal-Agent Fukuyama" src="images/principal-agent.png"></p>
<p>With the outgoing edges representing the exchange of information for policy between the actors, and the reflective edges representing accountability&hellip;
Here&rsquo;s how each can be improved with technology:</p>

<p>Walking backwards from Yochai Benkler&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Wealth of Networks&rdquo;, into Hayek&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Use of Knowledge in Society&rdquo;, and further into &ldquo;the Wealth of Nations&rdquo;, we see an evolution of the idea of decentralized infromation sourcing from economic benefit into more complex social media.</p>

<p>Privacy regulation (make joke about cookie banners), also something called the right to data portability(note about which legislations uphold it) (canont find this link where it had all countries and if they had the right), establishing that a user of digital services should be able to get out all their information in a &ldquo;reasonably straightforward&rdquo; way.</p>
<p>(into a note: Reasonably straightforward, as interpreted by big tech, currently means non standardized,  finding some specific url hidden somewhere in your account netherworld&rsquo;s setting, selecting which categories you need, the archive format, the data format, the file split size, the file destination, and then waiting up to 24 hours for a link that takes you back to the account settings)</p>
<p>Yet in these account takeouts you can get so much information that is invisible when using OpenID, such as you entire google search history, your whole location history, emails, and your private messages </p>

<p>Lucky for us all this data is locked up in the cool and secure (lapland datacenter) datacenters of the tech giants, with the legal system waiting for a moose to smash into window to sue the companies for privacy violations.</p>
<p>There is little cross-contamination between the datasets, Google knowing your searches, Facebook knowing your friends and amazon knowing what you purchase. The traditional third party processors hold some of that data (Nielsen, Liveramp etc), but no one has the full picture except you.</p>

<p>(How does this data then become useful?) Let&rsquo;s consider our general relation with ads. Some might go to the extent of Norway and even ban targeted ads (or also https://noyb.eu/en).

<p>What&rsquo;s important is that not only the policy implemented is scientifically sound, but also that it aligns with the morality of the principal.</p>

<p>[important: draw a difference between people that can do some optimal interpolation -&gt; bayesians, vs people that have very biased interpolation -&gt; moralists. morality bad. spectrum of moralisms -&gt; how quickly you can update your beliefs in a bayesian way]</p>
<p>According to Haidt, the public is fundamentally moral: Disconnect in perception of legitimacy → the principal might not have as much data about the global state as the agent, so analyzes choice based on internal value and personality model</p>
<p>Personality and morality -&gt; somewhat stable internal state, hard to change. is also praty genetic, carrying over information from the previous generation.</p>
<p>Like Haidt, i believe pluralism of moralities is generally positive. yet when i first read his book some years ago i was still finding myself thinking &ldquo;oh that&rsquo;s how i&rsquo;m gonna convince these dumb (prograssives/coservatives) that my (conservative/prograssive) view is the best!&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll provide a more abstract analogy to hopefully avoid this for you.</p>
<p>Imagine politics as an optimization problem using gradient descent. the difference with gradient descent is that local knowledge is not unique: you can image of two forces. we can use one person on the left and one on the right as simplification (this side is steeper! no, this side is steeper!).
The set of points is the same (the empirical truth) but both characters have different interpretations for these points using their morality. (give an example)</p>
<p>with democracy we now have millions of these agents and millions of different moralities.
For a government to be perceived as legitimate we have to pick the average of all interpretations of the points. the government could also get lucky and reach the optimum picking one of the curves at random, but that&rsquo;s not the point of democracy.</p>
