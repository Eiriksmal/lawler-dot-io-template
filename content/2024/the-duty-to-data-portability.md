I have just finished reading [The Revolt of the Public](https://press.stripe.com/the-revolt-of-the-public) by Martin Gurri which provides a great analysis of the current sociopolitical climate in the West. I'm a software enginner in Europe, and with Putin playing Risiko,<label for="sn-aea" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Or rather Axis & Allies since everyone seems to be making up new rules as they play.</span> Die Gr√ºnen cannibalizing Germany‚Äôs energy sector and the looming possibility of a Trump re-election, I've started thinking that maybe tech can help.

Gurri argues that the public's revolt<label for="sn-gurri" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-gurri" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="sidenote">Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Strett, Tea Party movement, Indignados, Brexit, etc.</span> is not just a rebellion against specific policies or leaders, but a fundamental challenge to the top-down, hierarchical structures of the 20th century. This rebellion is fueled by the information explosion, which has democratized knowledge and destabilized traditional power structures.

The results of such destabilization have been chaos so far, but as I come down the unreasonably optimistic wave of the tech sector,<label for="sn-salaries" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-salaries" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="sidenote">Maybe it's just the severance package?</span> I'm compelled to embrace the vision at the end of the book against such political nihilism: I will argue that in the past coupld of years a number of crucial technological innovations have made this vision possible, and we just need a small cultural step to adopt a framework of this type.

<!-- For the theoretical foundations of my thesis, I‚Äôll try to reconcile Fukuyama, Blockchain, Data rights, and Erlang‚Äôs actor model (?) oversimplyfing the world like a fellow Grug Brained Developer does.<label for="sn-grug" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

[Definitely not Erlang then](https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-concurrency), I think I meant the Principal-agent Model.
</span> -->

In The Origins of Political Order, Fukuyama identifies 3 pillars of Modern government: state capacity, accountability and Rule of Law. Up close, these pillars are an intertwined network of actors, as represented by <del>Erlang's concurrency model</del> the principal-agent model, where the public (Principal) hire government offcials (Agent) to enact policy to their benefit. When token prediction models will exterminate humanity and we'll be left with just computers, this model will be no longer needed, and will be more akin to a blockchain, where each actor has perfect information of the world and can be both the agent and the principal. 

If we try to forcibly stretch Fukuyama‚Äôs framework over the principal-agent model, we obtain something like this:

With the outgoing edges representing the exchange of information for policy between the actors, and the reflective edges representing accountability...
Here's how each can be improved with technology:

Walking backwards from Yochai Benkler's "The Wealth of Networks", into Hayek's "The Use of Knowledge in Society", and further into "the Wealth of Nations", we see an evolution of the idea of decentralized infromation sourcing from economic benefit into more complex social media.

(some examples about google and facebook data. focus on raw data and possiblity of info for next section)

Privacy regulation (make joke about cookie banners), also something called the right to data portability(note about which legislations uphold it) (canont find this link where it had all countries and if they had the right), establishing that a user of digital services should be able to get out all their information in a "reasonably straightforward" way.

(into a note: Reasonably straightforward, as interpreted by big tech, currently means non standardized,  finding some specific url hidden somewhere in your account netherworld's setting, selecting which categories you need, the archive format, the data format, the file split size, the file destination, and then waiting up to 24 hours for a link that takes you back to the account settings)

Yet in these account takeouts you can get so much information that is invisible when using OpenID, such as you entire google search history, your whole location history, emails, and your private messages

Lucky for us all this data is locked up in the cool and secure (lapland datacenter) datacenters of the tech giants, with the legal system waiting for a moose to smash into window to sue the companies for privacy violations.

There is little cross-contamination between the datasets, Google knowing your searches, Facebook knowing your friends and amazon knowing what you purchase. The traditional third party processors hold some of that data (Nielsen, Liveramp etc), but no one has the full picture except you.

Personal privacy is fundamental, how free would you be if you knew that your every 

Yet i will explain how all this data would be invaluable for a policymaker. 

(borrowing a concept from differential privacy that )

the green dot being a zero-knowledge proof if you're from the web3 crowd

but how do we ensure that the data is indeed used for policy and is aggregate? confidentiality ...

Let's consider our general relation with ads. Some might go to the extent of Norway and even ban targeted ads (or also https://noyb.eu/en). Your milage may vary but on average very few of the ads we see have anything to do with us.<label for="sn-maggots" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

# Wrapping up

the reason why I've mentioned the A word (üëª advertising üëª) before is that advertising is central to this.
