I have just finished reading [The Revolt of the Public](https://press.stripe.com/the-revolt-of-the-public) by Martin Gurri which provides a great analysis of the current sociopolitical climate in the West. I live in Paris right now, and with Putin playing Risiko and the looming possibility of a Trump re-election, [these themes have started materializing]. 

Right in the spirit of the events in the book, I feel like proposing my armchair political scientist view on the subject, with a minimal claim of legitimacy stemming from having been involved in privacy and identity throughout my career in software development.

Gurri argues that the public's revolt is not just a rebellion against specific policies or leaders, but a fundamental challenge to the top-down, hierarchical structures of the 20th century. This rebellion is fueled by the information explosion, which has democratized knowledge and destabilized traditional power structures.
