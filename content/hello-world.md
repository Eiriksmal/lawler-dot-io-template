Summary: We all have to start somewhere&hellip;

When learning computer programming, it's traditional to begin one's journey towards mastering the syntax by instructing the computer to print "Hello, world!" on the screen.

This is Python's _Hello, world!_:

    #!python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    print("Hello, world!")    

And this is PHP's:

```php
    <?php
    echo "Hello, world!";
    ?>
```
