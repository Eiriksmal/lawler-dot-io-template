## It depends
In this age of always-connected smartphones, you have the *temerity* of not knowing something. But you *must* know, so you summon the necessary courage from deep within---you confess your ignorance to the local oracle. The expert listens patiently as you explain the situation. You finish, eager to receive the oracle's wisdom. He pauses, then watches the hope in your eyes dissolve into irritation as the careful response is given: "It depends."

So what *does* a CTO do all day, anyway? A company's current size, the market it operates in, whether it's publicly traded or privately held, whether they're selling goods or services, whether they consider technology a source of revenue or attach it to a cost center---all of these alter a CTO's day-to-day actions. But is the role itself the same? Is there some core set of shared responsibilities that transcends a company's stage?

In *The E-Myth Revisited*, Michael Gerber creates a compelling case that the work a company requires does not change from 0 employees to 100,000. The only thing that changes? The faces *doing* that work. <label for="mn-duh" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-duh" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">We can quickly see that the amount of *time* a company must spend on all of those tasks is very different at 0 vs 100,000 employees.</span>A solo founder has to be everything: CEO, salesman, widget-maker, customer service rep... The list goes on. The company, however, *needs* all of those tasks to be performed, or it won't function. If the founder does not take care of the customers, they'll find another place to spend their money. If the founder won't make the widgets, spin the wrenches, or sling the code? There's nothing to sell---the business is kaput.

## Okay, so what's a CTO?
The *E-Myth* concept is one I've struggled with for years. Especially when thinking about something as nebulous as whatever a Chief Technology Officer is supposed to be. As a startup CTO, I didn't feel "legitimate." After all, Amazon's CTO has a PhD. Stripe's CTO invented a new cryptographically-sound encryption scheme over the course of a weekend. What am I even supposed to be doing, as CTO? <label for="mn-cypherpunk" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-cypherpunk" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">I'll never make it as a [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk#Origin_of_the_term,_and_the_Cypherpunks_mailing_list).</span>

Several of the CTOs in my forum in [7CTOs](https://7ctos.com/) were managing sprawling teams of 20, 40, or 80+ engineers. <label for="mn-scary" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-scary" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">We often use "resource" to mean "an item that gets consumed in the creation of a thing," then call a company's employees, living people!, human...resources. ðŸ¤”</span> I put them in a mental box labeled "legitimate CTOs." At the same time, I would sneer at CTOs who spent all day coding, rather than guiding others in the creation of code. They went in the same box I put myself in "illegitimate CTOs." A neat, orderly system only existing in two states: Legitimate or not. CTO or impostor.

When that mental abstraction leaked into my speech in front of a fellow 7CTOs forum member, he challenged me on the conceit of a "legitimate CTO." We had a long Socractic dialogue centering around concepts I'd learned from the *E-Myth*. Through a series of painful questions, it was clearly revealed that "legitimate" and "illegitimate" descriptors for CTOs are nonsensical. Whether a CTO is *good at his job* is a separate matter from legitimacy.

This fresh perspective was vital for understanding more about what a CTO provides to his company.
