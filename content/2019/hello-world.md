## The Beginning

When learning computer programming, it's traditional to begin one's journey towards mastering the syntax by instructing the computer to print [Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#History) on the screen.

This is Python's *Hello, World!*:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print("Hello, World!")
``` 

And this is PHP's:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

This is your blog's hello world!
