Description: Today, I deleted my Twitter account. Goodbye, Mr. Dorsey.
Status: Published

<section markdown="1">

Today, I deleted my Twitter account. If you visit my old handle, you get a friendly message from Twitter that `This account doesn't exist` and, wouldn't you please try searching for another? Anything to keep the drip of content going. Anything to propel artificial views to keep advertiser dollars rolling in.

I can't even remember what year I deleted my Facebook account. 2015? 2016? It's been a long time. My personal philosophies have never lined up with the big tech companies, especially not Twitter and Facebook, but Twitter always seemed innocuous enough. But today's "historic" events gave me the "courage" to finally delete the thing.

Farewall, Mr. Dorsey. You can join Misters Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Cook in the short list of companies with which I will not associate.

## Goals
My plans for this year:

- Keep it together, man.
- Get better at mountain biking.
- Find more productive uses for my time than scrolling through the news and reading about bikes.
