# Lawler.io

This is it. Everything you need to clone [Lawler.io](https://lawler.io) is here.

The _master_ branch was [renamed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53377423/removing-github-profile-repos-from-google-search) to _lawler_ so Google and friends won't crawl its contents.

## How to build this website
You need pip, the Python package manager, and a copy of Python 2.7 or 3.x:

1. `pip install pelican`
2. `pip install Markdown`
3. `pip install webassets`
4. `dnf install yuicompressor` <-- needed for webassets, which installs yuicompressor. Adjust the binary name in the `YUICOMPRESSOR_EXECUTABLE` setting in `pelicanconf.py` to match whatever method you use to install the actual compressor.
5. That's it! You can now run `make devserver` from the root directory and navigate to localhost:8000. `make rsync_upload` will build and publish the site to the remote server.

(Parallel instructions in https://lawler.io/about/)

### Useful commands
`./generate_entry.py "Post Title Here"` to generate a new post, with metadata placeholders inserted
- `make rsync_upload` to publish the site
- All configuration is in `/pelicanconf.py`
- `/publishconf.py` contains overrides of `pelicanconf` for the `make publish` command (executed by `rsync_upload`). Intended for prod values, keys, etc.
- `pygmentize -S default -f html -a .highlight > default_code.css` For when Pygment/CodeHilite needs a kick in the pants. (Newer versions of Pelican/Pygment/Python Markdown changed how the generated HTML is structured.)

## About the website

When computer-programming/engineering types have a website, it's traditional to <del>brag about</del> explain the technology used to create and serve the site. I have no idea who actually reads these summaries, but for posterity's sake&hellip;

The website is a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) created by [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), a Python static site generator. I added a few custom Python extensions to bend the Jinja2 templating engine to my will.

I created the theme myself&mdash;both the desktop and mobile variants. The basis for the theme is Dave Liepmann's [Edward Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/), which powers the lovely serifed font and gorgeous margin notes you see throughout Lawler.io.

Major thanks to Jody Frankowski's [Blue Penguin theme](https://github.com/jody-frankowski/blue-penguin) (which, itself, was based on pelican-mockingbird) and Claudio Walser's [FH5CO marble theme](https://github.com/claudio-walser/pelican-fh5co-marble-example) as guides to figure out how to use some of Pelican's less-documented areas for advanced themes.
